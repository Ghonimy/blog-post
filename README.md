# mern-blog-post

This is a website for blog posts and it uses the following tools:

- React
- React-Router-DOM
- Nodejs
- MongoDB

The backend is deployed on Heroku and the Frontend is deployed on Netlify, as for the CORS I used the Cors lib to allow access from Netlify to Heroku.

The website has most of common functionality that every other blog post site utilizes.
